# Crimson Zamboni Deathmatch Webhook Proxy

The [Crimson Zamboni Deathmatch](https://crimsonzamboni.com/deathmatch.html) for DayZ provides a webhook for Discord.

This proxy server sits in between the game and Discord, allowing you to track events and customize posts to Discord.

Currently, it only sends a message showing the longest kill at the end of a match, but it could be used to track and post other scoreboard type stats as well.
